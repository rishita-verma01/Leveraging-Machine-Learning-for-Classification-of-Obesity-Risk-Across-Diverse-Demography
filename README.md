## 📌 Abstract

Obesity is considered a global public health emergency due to its high risk of several chronic disorders, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Due to the complexity of early risk prediction, obesity requires early interventions or classifications of individualized health management. This study demonstrates the implementation of several ML techniques to provide a comprehensive cross-frame study on the prediction of obesity risk. Application of multiple models, namely, LR (Logistic Regression), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor), DTC (Decision Tree Classifier), GB (Gradient Boosting), MLP (Multiperceptron Network), and FNN (FeedForward Neural Network), are employed to check the performance on three benchmark datasets. The results showed that the accuracy of each model varied in the predictions, underlining both the benefits and the drawbacks of each approach in different scenarios. This study aims to develop more useful tools in clinical and preventive health, as it gives insight into comparing complex neural networks to conventional machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of obesity. The gradient boosting algorithm achieved the highest accuracy in all data sets, with a precision of 95% for Dataset 1 and 98% for both Dataset 2 and Dataset 3. This work underscores the potential of machine learning in public health and provides a foundation for policymakers and healthcare professionals to develop personalized and preventive strategies to combat obesity.

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. 📥 Data Sourcing

Three benchmark datasets from Kaggle were used for obesity risk prediction:

- **Dataset 1** includes:
  - Gender, Age, Height, Weight
  - Family history of obesity
  - FAVC (Frequent consumption of high-calorie food)
  - FCVC (Frequency of vegetable intake)
  - NCP (Number of meals), CAEC (Snacking habits)
  - SMOKE, CH2O (Water intake), SCC (Calorie monitoring)
  - FAF (Physical activity), TUE (Technology usage)
  - CALC (Alcohol consumption), MTRANS (Transportation mode)

- **Dataset 2** contains:
  - ID, Age, Gender, Height, Weight, BMI, and Obesity Label

- **Dataset 3** includes:
  - Age, Gender, Height, Weight, BMI, Physical Activity Level, Obesity Category

All datasets were filtered and cleaned for consistency and usability during model training.

### 2. 🔧 Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values using imputation or removal
- Standardized/normalized continuous variables
- Encoded categorical features using **Label Encoding** or **One-Hot Encoding**
- Split datasets into **80% training** and **20% testing**

### 3. 🧠 Cross-Framework Analysis

Multiple ML algorithms were applied across different frameworks to ensure robust and comparable results:

- **Models Used:**
  - Logistic Regression (LR)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
  - Gradient Boosting (GB)
  - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)

- **Frameworks Used:**
  - `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow/Keras`, and `PyTorch`

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy
  - Recall
  - F1-score

This cross-framework approach provided greater reproducibility and ensured fairness in model comparison.

## ✨ Novel Insights

### ⚖️ Gender-Based Obesity Risk Analysis

An important highlight of this research is the **comparative gender-based obesity risk** analysis across three datasets:

- 📊 **Dataset 1**: Indicated that **females** were more prone to obesity.
- ⚖️ **Dataset 2**: Showed an **equal risk** for both genders.
- 👨‍🔬 **Dataset 3**: Revealed a **higher obesity risk among males**.

These contrasting results emphasize the **influence of demographic, behavioral, and environmental factors** on obesity trends across genders. This insight supports the development of **personalized healthcare strategies** tailored to specific populations and risk factors.

> 🖼️ *Figure 2 in the paper provides a graphical representation of this gender-based comparison.*
